Week 1: Introduction to Python - Learn about Python syntax, data types, variables, and basic operations.\\n2. Week 2: Control flow and functions - Dive into if statements, loops, and functions in Python.\\n3. Week 3: Data structures - Explore lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets in Python.\\n4. Week 4: File handling and modules - Understand how to read and write files, as well as import modules in Python.\\n5. Week 5: Object-oriented programming - Learn about classes, objects, and inheritance in Python.\\n6. Week 6: Libraries and frameworks - Familiarize yourself with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.\\n7. Week 7: Practice coding exercises - Solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank to reinforce your skills.\\n8. Week 8: Review and mock interviews - Review key concepts and participate in mock interviews to prepare for your Data Science interview.\\n\\nRemember to practice regularly and apply what you've learned to real-world projects. Good luck with your interview preparation! Let me know if you have any other questions.\""
